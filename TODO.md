#Team programming to-do list:
----------------------------

#IMPORTANT!!!
###TEST ALL COMPLETED API SYSTEMS ON OLD ROBOT!!!

#General:
* Write wait for distance functions
* Write move/turn for distance functions
* Write API wiki
* ~~Update header file for encoder.c and ruler.c with all functions~~
* Add tick to measurement functions to the ruler system
* ~~Add system timer in timer.c~~
* ~~Add move for time functions to simplemovement.c~~
* Add prefix and suffix compatability to the debug stream


#Long term goals:
* Remove all constants from encoder system and replace with only math, while still retaining full functionality.
* Implement a PID controller to functions in simplemovement

###Tutorial on how to edit this list:
-------------------------
Add your required task to the section in which it should go, using the format shown in that section.
Ex.
####Long term goals:
* make the robot fly

When goals are complete, mark them with a strikethrough, several people will check that they are complete,
and then they will be removed from the list.
Ex.
####Long term goals:
* ~~make the robot fly~~
