void moveStrafe(byte power, short distance/*We need to decide: cm or in?*/) {}
void turnInPlace(byte power, short deg) {}
void turnSwing(byte power, short deg) {}

//Low priority
//move in a spiral, like r = x in a polar graph
//variables may need changing
void turnSpiral(byte power, short distance/*We need to decide: cm or in?*/, short deg) {}
void moveDiagonal(char vect/*which diagonal?*/, byte power, short distance/*We need to decide: cm or in?* {}
