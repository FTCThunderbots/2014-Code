1. Most methods should be placed in their own c header files, so that we can easily #include them. This will mean we no longer have to copy methods across files whenever we want a new program.

2. Configurations, such as default servo positions, motor scales, debug options, and joystick positions should all be placed as constants in configuration classes. Provided they are not static, we can use #include to access them. This will mean there is only one number to edit whenever a configuration needs to be changed, such as a servo position if the servo is reattached, or a default joystick position if the joysticks are acting up and reading +-30 as default, or a speed limit if Seraphina is driving again.

3. Git must be used for everything. Everything. Everything.

If anyone needs help using git, ask me (Zach) or Daniel.

Git is love. Git is life. Resistance is futile.
