How to use the API:

The following three lines can be defined in any program. Only the last of the three lines is required. Put these at the top of the program, directly below the configurations.

#define timersused 0
#define rulersused 0
#include "api.c"

If the first two lines are left out, they will default to zero. If your program uses a variable amount of timers, set the amount used to a high estimate, because very little extra memory is consumed before the timer or ruler is defined.

The following line should be the very first line of your main task.

initializeAPI();

You're all set! Your program can now use any methods defined inside the API.

Better instructions for defining keyword:

1. configfile should be a string literal containing the file name of
the program's custom config file. To use the default config file,
simply don't include this line.

2. timersused should be an integer representing the maximum amount of
timer objects that the program will use. There can be more timers requested
here than the program actually uses, with very very little wasted memory
space

3. rulersused should be the same thing as timersused, but for ruler objects
instead of timer objects.

How to create a timer object:

Timer_t foo;
initTimer(&foo);
startTimer(&foo);
// after this, the timer will be running
// all functions should use the & (address of) operator on your timer object.
