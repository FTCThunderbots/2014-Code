PRE-SCRIMMAGE TO-DO LIST

*Please add your name in parenthesis to whatever you add to the list. Please do not remove anything without discussing it first*

Currently supported and known working files: sys_test_v2.c; main_teleop_v2.c

To-do list:

1. Make sure the teleop works perfectly with every single function on the robot. Triple-check everything. The most current tele-op program is main_teleop_v2.

2. We need to precisely calibrate the power/time values of the backboard and the lift grab, or potentially better, replace them with continuous movement. The lift motor will probably be better fit to be continuous, but will still take adjusting.

3. Make sure that the lift is going to replace a grab pin altogether. If not, change the code to reflect this.

4. Mirror all config changes to the autonomous programs. The most current config is currently in default_config.c, main_teleop_v2.c, or either of the sys_test_vX files.

5. Define a list of autonomous programs that we might use at this competion. Only work on those.

6. IMPORTANT: Fully test/debug/correct all autonomous programs that we might be using. Make sure they all work, (all 1?) and get them to line up reasonably well with whatever they need to line up with.

7. Do not spend any time on the encoders. There's too much to do on that, and we will not have time to get the system working well. Beyond that, we don't have any autonomous programs written to use encoders, so it's pointless anyway.
