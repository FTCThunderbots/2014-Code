Daniel Grimshaw:
  Updated all codes so that they should work with robotc (lots of casting and a few new methods in movement.c)
  Created comment box (will be deprecated (essentially a todo list) after code works) in movement.c
  Corrected movement.h method declarations to match movement.c
  Added declarations in movement.h for movement of a certain distance
  Decided that from now on all files in the Journal directory will be .log files
