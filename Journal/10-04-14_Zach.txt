Today, the team's GitHub organization was set up, and all pre-existing code has been restructured into a much, much more practical repository system. Repositories are sorted by year, and folders inside the repositories may reflect the structure used for the code base of that year. This way, different years can more easily use different organizational systems, and the entire team's code base looks much cleaner from the outside.
